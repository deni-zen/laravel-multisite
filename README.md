# laravel-multisite
Allows per-subdomain configuration for Laravel applications. Used for SaaS-style multi-tenant applications that serve the same application to many clients, each on their own subdomain (typically). 

## Coming Soon!
I've already written 90% of the code necessary for this, but in order to release it as open-source I need to decouple it from the application I wrote it for and "package" it for release. Unfortunately I just don't have the time to do that at the moment, but check back later to see if there's any progress...
